# Pebbble Refactoring Progress Tracker

## üéØ **Overall Strategy: Service-First Extraction**
- **Goal**: Extract business logic into services before breaking down components
- **Approach**: Additive first (create services), then gradual migration
- **Branch**: `refactor/service-extraction`

## üìä **Progress Status**

### Phase 1: Service Creation ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- [x] **AudioService.js** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Extract audio recording logic ‚úÖ
  - [x] Extract file upload logic ‚úÖ
  - [x] Extract audio validation logic ‚úÖ
  - [x] Update audioRecorder.js to use service ‚úÖ
  - [x] Test recording functionality works ‚úÖ
- [ ] **PlaylistService.js** - ‚è≥ CURRENT TASK
  - [ ] Extract playlist CRUD operations
  - [ ] Extract playlist validation logic
  - [ ] Update playlistCreator.js to use service
- [ ] **FinalizationService.js** - üîÑ PENDING
  - [ ] Extract encryption/upload logic
  - [ ] Extract progress tracking logic
  - [ ] Update playlistFinalization.js to use service

### Phase 2: Component Breakdown üîÑ PENDING
- [ ] Split playlistCreator.js into smaller components
- [ ] Split playlistFinalization.js into UI + service
- [ ] Clean up mainApp.js routing

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes üîÑ PENDING
- [ ] Memory leak fixes (now easier in smaller components)
- [ ] Audio compatibility fixes (centralized in AudioService)
- [ ] Error recovery improvements

## üîç **Current Session Context**

### Last Completed Action:
```
PREVIOUS SESSION END STATE:
- Created branch: refactor/service-extraction
- About to start creating AudioService.js
- No files modified yet
- Agreed on incremental, additive approach
```

### Current Task Details:
```javascript
// CURRENT TASK: Create services/AudioService.js
// 
// Logic to extract FROM audioRecorder.js:
// 1. getUserMedia() recording logic
// 2. File upload/validation logic  
// 3. Audio format compatibility logic
// 4. Audio duration calculation
//
// Target: Move business logic out, keep UI in component
```

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Create `js/services/AudioService.js` file
2. Extract recording methods from `audioRecorder.js`
3. Extract file upload methods from `audioRecorder.js`
4. Update `audioRecorder.js` to use AudioService
5. Test that recording still works exactly the same

## üö® **Critical Principles (DO NOT CHANGE)**

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- **Keep existing EventBus** - don't change communication pattern
- **Keep existing database services** - don't touch messageDb.js, storageService.js
- **Keep existing encryption** - don't touch encryptionService.js
- **Additive approach** - create new services alongside existing code first

### Files to NEVER modify:
- `js/services/encryptionService.js` 
- `js/services/eventBus.js`
- `js/services/messageDb.js`
- `js/services/nfcService.js`
- `js/services/storageService.js`
- `js/utils/log.js`
- `js/utils/urlParser.js`

### Testing Strategy:
- Test each extracted service independently
- Test that components still work after service integration
- Keep existing functionality 100% intact

## üìù **Session Resumption Prompt Template**

```
I'm continuing the Pebbble app refactoring we started. Here's the context:

CURRENT PHASE: [Phase from tracker above]
CURRENT TASK: [Current task from tracker above]  
LAST COMPLETED: [Last completed action from tracker above]
BRANCH: refactor/service-extraction

ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:
- Service-first extraction (create services, then migrate components)
- Additive approach (don't break existing code)
- Keep EventBus communication pattern
- Never modify: encryptionService.js, eventBus.js, messageDb.js, nfcService.js, storageService.js

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
[Copy from "Next Immediate Steps" above]

Please help me continue from where we left off. What should be the next specific action?
```

## üîß **Session Handoff Documentation**

### Before Each Break:
1. **Update the tracker** with exact current state
2. **Commit with descriptive message**: `refactor: extract audio recording to AudioService (partial)`
3. **Document exact next steps** in the tracker
4. **Note any discovered issues** or decisions made

### Resumption Strategy:
1. **Share the updated tracker**
2. **State exact current task**  
3. **Reference specific files/lines** that need work
4. **Ask for specific next action** rather than general guidance

## üéØ **Commit Message Strategy**

```bash
# Good commit messages for continuity:
git commit -m "refactor: create AudioService.js with recording logic

- Extracted getUserMedia recording from audioRecorder.js
- Added audio format detection logic
- Service ready for integration
- audioRecorder.js not modified yet (next step)"

git commit -m "refactor: integrate AudioService into audioRecorder.js

- Updated audioRecorder.js to use AudioService
- Recording functionality verified working
- Ready to move to file upload extraction"
```

## üîÑ **Continuity Insurance**

### Before Starting Each Session:
1. **Review the tracker** to understand current phase
2. **Check the last few commits** to see recent changes
3. **Run the app** to ensure it still works
4. **Identify the specific next task** from the tracker

### During Each Session:
1. **Update tracker as we progress**
2. **Make small, focused commits**
3. **Test after each major change**
4. **Document any new decisions or discoveries**

Would you like me to create this tracker file in your repository? Then we can update it as we progress, and you'll have a perfect resumption guide for future sessions.

## üöÄ **Ready to Start with This Safety Net?**

With this system:
- You can hand me the tracker + current task and I'll know exactly where we are
- Each commit tells the story of our progress
- No risk of forgetting decisions or breaking previous work
- Clear path forward always documented

**Shall we create the tracker file first, then begin the AudioService extraction?**
